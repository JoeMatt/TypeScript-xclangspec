Xcode Syntax Highlighting for TypeScript

This adds syntax highlighting for TypeScript source files to Xcode. 

Packaged for Xcode 10.1 from original repo at https://github.com/steventroughtonsmith/lua-xclangspec, which in turn was packaged for Xcode 9.2 from original repo at https://github.com/bastos/lua-xcode-coloring.

```
This software as-is I provide
No warranties expressed or implied
Use it as-is
I'm not in the biz
So no lawsuits when Xcode is fried
```

* Language highlighting is stolen from Xcode's JavaScript.xclangspec.
* I had to pick a comment style, so I chose `//`
